I finally was able to complete the assignment. This was one of my favorite labs to do.
I collaborated with nobody for this assignment.
I thought the most important parts were learning how to access and read files.
I read the manual first, multiple times, then began to form my code.
I wouldn't approach this differently.

Surprisingly, my file parsing logic was quite sound and that allowed me to get through this assignment well, although I spent lots of time.
I finished completely.
I spent about 10 hours, I think.

The hardest part was really just visualizing the logic and then putting it into code.
The lab manual was less thorough than previous instances, I would make it more detailed.
The point distribution seems fine.
The lectures helped for sure, especially the File IO lecture.
